// However, that requires us to make sure to make the depth buffer read-only,
// and render all of our polygons from back to front in order to avoid blending problems
// we can avoid all of the above by using the discard keyword to completely discard fragments
// when the alpha value of the texture map is below a certain value


// graph: two types of edges, one between the element itself and the other between two different elements if they contact each other
// glycogen: ??? how to abstract them ??
